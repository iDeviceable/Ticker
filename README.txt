Supported Devices
	
	-This is a list of devices that have been 
	tested and proven to work properly with
	Ticker (known support for other devices will
	come in the future. In order for me to test
	the app, I need to share the application
	with people that have other devices. This
	means that if you download the app on your
	phone, and your device is not on the list,
	you are at risk to potential problems such
	as frequent crashing, gui not fitting properly
	and more. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
